title: "Activating the Connected Worker for Emissions Surveillance"

At a high level, we all should know that emissions are bad for the environment, especially hydrocarbon emissions like methane that are many times more powerful greenhouse gasses than CO2.  Being able to quickly detect and automate responses to these emissions can greatly help monitor and reduce emissions from companies in many different industries.

There are also other types of emissions at industrial and manufacturing sites that can be tracked for worker safety.  In the Oil & Gas industry, it is common to have “sour gas” or “sour oil”.  This means it contains high amounts of Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S), which is extremely toxic for workers. If there is ever a leak at a processing facility, personnel have to follow strict procedures to make sure they stay safe.  

It would be beneficial if the worker was connected to the sensors on and around him so that they are aware of any and all health and safety risks and to also be able to take direct measurements themselves, with real-time feedback.

In this workshop, we will learn how to build both wearable and stationary IoT devices that monitor gas conditions using the AWS IoT stack.

This workshop can only be run at AWS-run events, as there is specific hardware required to complete.
