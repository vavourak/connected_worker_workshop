If you are participating in an AWS instructor led workshop, please follow these steps to configure your Event Engine account. If you are using your own account, move on to the next page.

**_NOTE:_** If you do not have a Team Hash you will need that from the event organizer to begin.

The AWS Event Engine was created to help AWS field teams run Workshops, GameDays, Bootcamps, Immersion Days, and other events that require hands-on access to AWS accounts.

Open a browser and navigate to the event engine login page: [dashboard.eventengine.run](https://dashboard.eventengine.run). You will be presented with terms and login page. Please read and understand the terms governing use of event engine accounts.
